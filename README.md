```

### Features

* Wireguard WebUI (via wg-easy)
* Two-factor authentication for the WebUI (Authelia)

### Requirements

### FAQ
**Q: I've run the playbook succesfully, but now I want to change the domain name/username/password. How can I do that?**

Edit the variable files, install dependencies for the new user and re-run the playbook:

```
cd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
nano inventory.yml
ansible-vault edit secret.yml
ansible-playbook run.yml
```


**Q: I can't access the Wireguard WebUI after running the playbook**

Most likely, the culprit is an incorrect domain name. Check the Bunkerweb logs:
```
docker logs bunkerweb
```

Another reason might be wrong SMTP credentials. Check out Authelia logs:
```
docker logs authelia
```


**Q: I can't copy the SSH key to my Windows machine**

On Windows, you might need to create the `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh` folder manually before running the commands at the end of the playbook:
```
mkdir C:\Users\<username>\.ssh
scp -P 22 root@<server-ip-address>:/tmp/id_ssh_ed25519 C:\Users\<username>\.ssh
ssh -p 22 <username>@<server-ip-address> -i C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_ssh_ed25519
```
